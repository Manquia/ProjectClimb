Hey, Micah! hope things are well with you.

I just got done taking the script I was working on for an auto-rigging skeleton and modifying the joint loactions
to match the Ethan body type. After the BBQ at cottage lake park today I will come back and do a down and dirty
rig for Ethan that is built by me. I don't know why but Maya just will not let me import any type of FBX item
from the past. I have done everything except uninstall and re-install the whole program.

but apperently this was an issue that was cause from an update? atleast that is what is said on the autodesk
forums and the maya reddit page.

anyway I have a backup on github so that incase stuff doesn't work, I can still have something of site to fall
 back on. I will also be adding the fbx versions of the skeleton and the headless mesh into
"Hans' art assets" folder.

anyway I gotta jet, I'll see you later.

Hans.
