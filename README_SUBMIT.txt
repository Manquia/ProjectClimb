Final Submission

-------- Submission Notes --------------------------------------------------

I got most everything I wanted just not quite all the polish details. 

I added Henry into the credits since he "playtested it" and gave valuable
feedback in the form of motivation. :) 

Hans Lee is also in the credits. The submitted build is has 1 model
(the hook on the ropes in the first level) that he created. He also
created a lot of animations for the character but we were unable to put
them into the game on time.

There is 1 missing animation for the player character which is the climb
animation. This is one of the polish details that I didn't get around to doing.
